    SIMP_IFP_MATRIX define which interaction of each
    amino acid residue that should be included and
    calculated. There are 6 flag (0 = OFF, 1 =  ON)
    for each residue. Each flag represent these interactions:
        1. Hydrophobic interaction
        2. Aromatic (Face to Face & Edge to Face)
        3. H-bond (Protein as Donor)
        4. H-bond (Protein as Acceptor)
        5. Electrostatic interaction (Protein +)
        6. Electrostatic interaction (Protein -)
